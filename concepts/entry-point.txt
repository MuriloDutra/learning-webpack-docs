An entry point is the first file webpack will read to start bundling your application.
Webpack is also capable of identifying the dependencies your entry point file has and then load them as well.
Once webpack loaded the dependencies from your entry point, it's gonna check if these dependencies also have
dependencies and load them and so on.

EXAMPLE:
module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
};
