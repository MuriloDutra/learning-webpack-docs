Plugins are responsible to offer a variety of possibilities to your final bundle,
like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.
They also serve the purpose of doing anything else that a loader cannot do

EXAMPLE:
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './src/index.html' })],
};
